TO DO:

- insert class="mini" into list-card items automatically
- restructure git profile so all versions of the site are in one repo
- project forms should have dynamic tags (changing excerpt info in article should change info on homepage)
- JS to automatically insert classes on excerpt ("mini" for related articles, "bold secondary" for projects on homepage)
- buttons should stay color when clicked (active)
- search results page (design like bbc)
- redesign image section (images should always be 16 x 9)
- maintenance page (get plugin)
- blog post section
- npm and gulp for auto ES5/es6 and webkit 
- redesign logo
- Write javascript to show menu on upwards scroll.
- Show links as visited when they have already been opened.
- Create logo to put on error page.
- create contact form (zem_contact_reborn)
- add svg envelope in icons div, when thoughts section is live
- sort reader view (header appears before logo, quote author doesnt have spacing)
- any changes to mobile header height needs to be reflected in min height error, archive)
- SVG version (pen tool) of my first name?
- redirect to section when clicking section in archive list
