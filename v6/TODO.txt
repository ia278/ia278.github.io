TO DO:

- insert class="mini" into list-card items automatically
- restructure git profile so all versions of the site are in one repo
- project forms should have dynamic tags (changing excerpt info in article should change info on homepage)
- JS to automatically insert classes on excerpt ("mini" for related articles, "bold secondary" for projects on homepage)
- buttons should stay color when clicked (active)
- redesign image section (images should always be 16 x 9)
- maintenance page (get plugin)
- npm and gulp for auto ES5/es6 and webkit 
- Show links as visited when they have already been opened.
- sort reader view (header appears before logo, quote author doesnt have spacing)
- any changes to mobile header height needs to be reflected in min height error, archive)
- redirect to section when clicking section in archive list
- no target javascript for class .no-target




- Edit header so the active class toggles depending on which list item is hovered over, but defaults to the current section if not
- Show search icon by changing colors
- Add jQuery for search bar
- Make form accessible (aria-labels, fieldsets etc.)

NOTES

- Changing the height of the logo requires the variable to also be changed, as this will update margins and headers.
