TO DO:

ADMIN 

- Learn npm and gulp for auto ES5/es6 and webkit
- Restructure git profile so all versions of the site are in one repo


CODE

- Add bottom border to search results (to seperate them slightly)
- Add jQuery for search bar (and show by changing fill color)
- Add styles for pre and code tags to base (probably highlight.js)
- Change list card to scale on hover, and make a greater area hyperlinked.
- Keep backgrounds internal to Textpattern
- Create SEO friendly image names with .htaccess
- Fix min height on about and posts pages
- Show links as visited when they have already been opened (:active?)
- Sort reader view (header appears before logo, quote author doesnt have spacing)
- Use Oswald for headers in articles


DESIGN

- Redesign favicon to have white background


FEATURES

- Allow users to share articles on social media
- Introduce a results div at the top of the page, summarising key results.
- Introduce tagging system for articles (smd_tags)
- subscribe to website (rss or plugin?)


FORMS

- Design search form on error page
- Design form error states
- Make form accessible (aria-labels, fieldsets etc.)
- Add footer maximum height (layout thrown out on big screens)


NOTES

- Changing the height of the logo requires the variable to also be changed, as this will update margins and headers.
