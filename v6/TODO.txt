TO DO:

ALL IN TEXTPATTERN 4.7.2

- design form error states
- Insert alignment div with javascript, not pure html
- Edit header so the active class toggles depending on which list item is hovered over, but defaults to the current section if not
- Show search icon (by changing fill color)
- Add jQuery for search bar
- Make form accessible (aria-labels, fieldsets etc.)
- Add bottom border to search results, to seperate them slightly
- Sort reader view (header appears before logo, quote author doesnt have spacing)
- Show links as visited when they have already been opened.
- buttons should stay color when clicked (active)
- no target javascript for class .no-target
- restructure git profile so all versions of the site are in one repo
- maintenance page (get plugin)
- npm and gulp for auto ES5/es6 and webkit 

NOTES

- Changing the height of the logo requires the variable to also be changed, as this will update margins and headers.
