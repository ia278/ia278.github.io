PAGES & MODULES
----------------------------------------

Seven page templates have been created (available at www.ia278.github.io/v6);

Archive     (used for general archives)
Article     (used for articles)
Error       (used for 404)
Index       (used for home)
List        (used for search results, section archives)
Posts       (used for work, thoughts, testing)
Single      (used for about)


Each of these page templates is made up of several replaceable modules. These are;


Error       (code for error hero)
Footer      (code for footer)
Head        (code for head)
Header      (code for header)
Hero        (code for hompeage hero)


Two modules act as placeholders for CMS generated content. These are;

Article     (placeholder for article content)
Single      (placeholder for single page content)


Article cards can be displayed in four different ways. The modules for these are;

Archive     (text only)
Featured    (large tiles, no description)
List        (full width horizontal tiles)
Posts       (grid view)


These should be used in different situations, with different design patterns.

Archive   - general archive pages, pagination
Featured  - index and post pages, max of 3 displayed
List      - search results & section archives, pagination 
Posts     - Any other situation, 'see more' button
