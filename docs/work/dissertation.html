          <p>How are concepts optimally developed from initial ideas?</p><br/>
          
          <p>By following three undergraduate engineering teams for five weeks during the early design stages of their group business and design projects, a greater understanding of the language used in design sessions and its role in developing ideas into concepts was gathered. The results obtained were split into several sections.</p><br/>
        
          <p>The first found an increase of 7% in “block frequency” between normal and critical episodes &#40;critical episodes discussing ideas included in the final design&#41;, with low overall rates of “support for blocks”. The second stage found while that criticism was rarely given in the early stages of NPD, standard criticism was given 164% more frequently than constructive, with increases of 8% and 20% in critical episodes respectively. Questioning rates were much higher, with the most popular type being those that helped understanding.</p><br/>
            
          <p>Adding to this, questions that required a higher level of cognitive thought or critical thinking to answer were more common in groups with leaders who had industrial experience in NPD &#40;six out of ten against five out of ten&#41;, with a dramatic increase in analytical questions &#40;+55%&#41; being observed, as well as a fall in understanding questions asked &#40;-13%&#41;. Part three saw that advancement of an idea was preferred instead of no advancement over three times as much for criticism, and over five times for questioning, but with no significant difference in normal and critical episodes. Saying this, chi-squared tests found the majority of raw percentage increases in this investigation to be minor, with only the relationship between industrial experience and the level of questioning significant.</p><br/>
          
          <p>Qualitative data findings were also presented in this study. Interaction dynamics notation found that while it was rare for a block to be supported, support for the answer was common in all groups. It was also discovered that most advancement did not arise due to questioning and criticism, but through statements and external feedback, and that one team member did the majority of criticism in all the teams. An incidental finding also discovered that, like the majority of research in this area shows, individual brainstorming led to a higher amount of ideas than group brainstorming.</p><br/>
          
          <p>However, as the majority of percentage changes gathered were proven to be insignificant by chi-squared tests, no rules for concept development can be recommended at this time.</p><br/>
