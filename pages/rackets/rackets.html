        <h2>Advancements in tennis racket design</h2>

        <div class="paragraphs">
          
          <p>The materials used to make tennis rackets have heavily changed since 1967. From wood to metals &#40;steel and aluminum&#41;, to firstly graphite reinforced and then 100% graphite rackets, a large evolution has taken place in the materials used that has had wide implications on the game today. In the modern era, graphite is still the material of choice, but it is often mixed with other materials such as basalt or graphene.</p><br/>
          
          <p>Changing the racket material has directly affected tennis rackets designs, as manufacturers realized that they could have larger racket head sizes or thicker beams, whilst maintaining &#40;or often reducing&#41; the weight of the racket. These advances have led to the ITF (International Tennis Federation) introducing new regulations to keep the game competitive, as well as banning products that would give players an unfair advantage. Another side effect of changing materials has been advances in other areas, such as stringing technology and playing styles/techniques.</p><br/>
        
          <p>This essay aims to highlight the major changes in the materials used to make tennis rackets, and how material changes forced certain design modifications. It also discusses the variations that these advances in material and design forced in the overall game, including the widespread use of topspin and the two handed backhand, why courts are slower today than in the past, and looks at the future of tennis racket design.</p>
