TO DO:

Small

- remove click event listener from sections/articles/footers after menu is hidden
- no hover on small screens
- buttons should stay color when clicked (active)
- change nth child 3 in about page so the name is different (resumes)
- get accepted to dribbble


Big

- article contents list (based on h2 and h3 titles)
- larger related cards
- search results page (design like bbc)
- redesign image section (images should always be 16 x 9)
- maintenance page (get plugin)
- blog post section
- sort out "project" ia - sizing issues on IE and Firefox
- npm and gulp for auto ES5/es6 and webkit 
- mobile menu change to hover instead of click (click messes up print view)
- JS to automatically add target="_blank" into article links
- replace bulleted lists with image based bulleted lists
